# Brainstorm: VivaVoz App Icon

## Brief

### Problem
Design the app icon for VivaVoz — a $5 Windows desktop app that captures voice, transcribes it locally using Whisper, and exports recordings as audio or text. No cloud. No subscription. Privacy-first.

### Context
- **Name:** VivaVoz (Portuguese: "viva" = alive + "voz" = voice). Tagline: "Your voice, alive."
- **Company:** Casulo AI Labs
- **Target:** Windows users who want local, private voice-to-text
- **Competitors:** SuperWhisper (Mac), Wispr Flow (cloud-based, subscription). VivaVoz is the affordable, local-first alternative.
- **Tech feel:** Modern, clean, Fluent design language (Windows 11 aesthetic)
- **Brand personality:** Approachable, trustworthy, alive. Not corporate. Not cold. Warm tech.

### Success Criteria
- Conveys "voice" or "sound" — avoid generic microphone if possible
- Readable at 16x16 (simple shapes, high contrast)
- Works on both light and dark backgrounds
- Feels modern and clean (Fluent/Windows 11)
- Distinctive enough to spot in a system tray full of icons
- The "alive" quality should come through — this isn't a dead tool, it's something vibrant

### Anti-patterns
- Generic microphone icon (every voice app does this)
- Too many details (won't survive 16x16)
- Skeuomorphic / outdated styles
- Cold/corporate/sterile look
- Waveform cliché (just a sine wave)
- Letters/text in the icon (doesn't scale)

### Inspiration
- The Portuguese word "viva" means both "alive" and is an exclamation of joy ("viva!")
- The concept of voice being alive, not just captured
- Sound as something organic, not mechanical
- The "casulo" (cocoon) brand — transformation, emergence
- System tray icons that work well: Discord (game controller), Slack (hashtag), Spotify (sound waves but distinctive)
