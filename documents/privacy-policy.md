# Privacy Policy — VivaVoz

**Last updated:** February 26, 2026

## Overview

VivaVoz is a local speech-to-text application. Your privacy is fundamental to our design — **all audio processing happens entirely on your device**.

## Data Collection

**VivaVoz does not collect, transmit, or store any personal data on external servers.**

Specifically:
- **Audio recordings** are processed locally using the Whisper AI model running on your machine. No audio is ever sent to the internet.
- **Transcriptions** are stored locally in a SQLite database on your device (`%LOCALAPPDATA%\VivaVoz`). They never leave your computer unless you explicitly export them.
- **No analytics, telemetry, or tracking** of any kind is included in the application.
- **No account creation** is required to use VivaVoz.

## Data Storage

All data is stored locally on your device:
- **Database:** `%LOCALAPPDATA%\VivaVoz\vivavoz.db` — contains your transcriptions and settings
- **Models:** Whisper AI models are stored locally and do not communicate with any server

## Third-Party Services

VivaVoz does not integrate with or send data to any third-party services. The application works entirely offline after installation.

## Data Deletion

Uninstalling VivaVoz removes the application. Your local data in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\VivaVoz` can be manually deleted if desired.

## Children's Privacy

VivaVoz does not knowingly collect any information from anyone, including children under 13.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Changes will be posted on this page with an updated revision date.
